<p class="projects-headline">These are some of my pet projects that I'm working on (or worked on) in my free time and they are in no way related to my current or any past employer.
You can find most of these projects on my <a href="http://www.github.com/amir-hadzic">github profile</a>.</p>

        <h2>Uedit</h2>
        <p>Uedit is a markdown editor, written in Javascript. It's light and doesn't depend on other libraries. Furthermore, the editor interface is not tightly integrated with the editor itself, so it's very easy to change it. Generally, it should be easy to modify the editor to suit your needs.</p>
        <p>Try it out <a href="http://www.randomshouting.com/uedit/">here</a>
        or look at the source code on <a href="http://www.github.com/amir-hadzic/uedit">github</a>.</p>

        <h2>FitGamePack</h2>
        <p>FitGamePack is composed of Fitgy and three sample games. The focus is on developing Fitgy which is a simple 2D game engine. Fitgy stands for Faculty of Information Technologies Graphics Thingy — yeah, I wasn't very creative with that one. One of the features of FitGamePack and Fitgy is that it's possible to run and develop it on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and even Mac but I haven't tested that one). It's pretty straightforward to start developing and playing around with the source code which will hopefully be interesting to someone. This was also a chance for me to brush up on my C++ skill set.</p>
