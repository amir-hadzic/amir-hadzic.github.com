<p><a href="https://www.github.com/amir-hadzic/uedit">uedit</a> is a markdown editor, written in Javascript. It's light and doesn't depend on other JS libraries. Furthermore, the editor interface is not tightly integrated with the editor itself, so it's very easy to change it. It's also easy to hack the editor and bend it to your will.</p>

<p><b>FitGamePack</b> is composed of Fitgy and a few (currently only two) sample games. The focus is on developing Fitgy which is a simple 2D game engine. As soon as Fitgy becomes somewhat stable I will focus on developing the sample games. Fitgy stands for Faculty of Information Technologies Graphics Thingy — yeah, I wasn't very creative with that one. One of the features of FitGamePack and Fitgy is that it's possible to run and develop it on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and even Mac but I haven't tested that one). It's pretty straightforward to start developing and playing around with the source code which will hopefully be interesting to someone. This was also a chance for me to brush up on my C++ skill set.</p>

<b>Tutorijali.net</b> is an updated version of the current <a href="http://tutorijali.net">tutorijali.net</a> website. Hopefully it will be released this year. The main goal of the project is to create a platform that will make knowledge sharing easier by making anyone able to write and publish tutorials. This project also involves rewriting and updating the current tutorials as they are outdated and/or badly written in the first place.</p>

    <p>Many other projects and experiments (like the <a href="/canvastyper.html">CanvasTyper</a>) that are not worth mentioning on this page.</p>
