<p><b>Note:</b> these are some of my pet projects that I'm working on in my free time and they are in no way related to my current employer.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/amir-hadzic/uedit">uedit</a> is a markdown editor, written in Javascript. It's light and doesn't depend on other JS libraries. Furthermore, the editor interface is not tightly integrated with the editor itself, so it's very easy to change it. It's also easy to hack the editor and bend it to your will.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
<p><b>FitGamePack</b> is composed of Fitgy and three sample games. The focus is on developing Fitgy which is a simple 2D game engine. Fitgy stands for Faculty of Information Technologies Graphics Thingy — yeah, I wasn't very creative with that one. One of the features of FitGamePack and Fitgy is that it's possible to run and develop it on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and even Mac but I haven't tested that one). It's pretty straightforward to start developing and playing around with the source code which will hopefully be interesting to someone. This was also a chance for me to brush up on my C++ skill set.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/amir-hadzic/FitGamePack">github</a>.</p>

    <li> 
    <p>Many other projects and experiments (like the <a href="/canvastyper.html">CanvasTyper</a>) that are not worth mentioning on this page.</p>

</ul>
