				<h1>We should work together</h1>

				<p>Do you need help? The substantial experience I have acquired in delivering solutions to customers while 
				either working as a freelancer or on a full time basis should be of great interest to You.</p>

				<p>Based on the requirements that we recognize I will guide you through all phases of delivering the software solution 
				to You or your users. Besides developing the actual solution I can manage your servers, deployment, issue tracking and 
				anything else we might need in order to meet our goal.</p>
				
				<p>Please do send me an email with more information about your specific problem and I will make sure to respond 
                promptly—informing you about possible solutions and if I am a good match for You and your problem. 
                You can reach me at <a href="mailto:amir.hadzic@randomshouting.com">amir.hadzic@randomshouting.com.</a></p>
