[How to Win Friends and Influence People][ref_link] is a book written by [Dale
Carnegie][author]. The book is a chest full of golden principles that one
should be guided by when interacting with other humans. When reading it for the
first time I used to go back to each chapter and re-read it at least once, just
to make sure that I got the most of it. Here's why I think that everyone trying
to be better at handling people should read and try to follow the guidelines
written by Mr. Dale in his book—first published in 1936.

<!-- more start -->

First of all I can't think of many professions that don't rely on effective
human interaction. Almost everyone can benefit from having good communication
skills when dealing with colleagues or customers. When it comes to colleagues
you need to know how to avoid resentment, build healthy relationships, deal
with criticism and arguments.  When interacting with your customers you need to
know how to sell your product or handle complaints for example.  If there's
something that you can do that would increase these skills by any margin, you
should pursue that opportunity.  This book will definitely help you build
"people skills".

Besides colleagues and customers, you have other personal relationships like
friends, your spouse and kids.  Who wouldn't want to be respected and loved by
most of the people in his or hers life? That of course takes a lot of work and
dedication but this book gives solid suggestions that can help you in reaching
that goal. 

Mr. Dale mentions throughout the book that simply reading and then forcing the
guidelines won't work.  According to him, one needs to have a deep desire to
change—to be better in dealing with people. Here are some quotes from the book
to help you understand what I mean.

> _If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable
> requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rule or
> technique. \[...\] What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving
> desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal
> with people._

Here's one more:

> _Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they
> come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about
> a new way of life._

The book is split into four parts. The parts are titled as:

 * Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
 * Six ways to Make People Like You
 * How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking
 * Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing
   Resentment

Trying to fundamentally change the way you are dealing with people is hard and
I'm talking from my own (although limited) experience. This book has given me
the tools that will help me in that process and for that I would recommend the
book to everyone who has similar intentions. It's obvious that being good at
handling people will help you in all aspects of your life. This book will show
you how to be better at doing just that.
