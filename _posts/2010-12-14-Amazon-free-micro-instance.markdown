I’m currently testing the [free EC2 micro instance][0] and I’m very pleased by now. I think it suits my needs and I can always upgrade if I need to. I have also abandoned my blog solution as I’m not interested in developing it further. Right now I need something ready and functional so I installed WordPress.

The only reason I have moved from App Engine is that I have more control over my server and application now. I’m the one installing Apache, Mysql and configuring the system. Also, I can use any technology I want to in order to develop my web applications instead of being constrained to Java or Python (not that I have anything against either one). Maybe it’s time to play with [Node.js][1].

**Update**: I have [migrated my blog][2] in the meantime to github.
