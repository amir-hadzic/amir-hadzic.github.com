_Note: Uedit is no longer actively maintained_

While working on the new, improved version of [Tutorijali.net][0] we have
decided to use the WMD markdown editor. While using it, we have discovered that
it has many annoying bugs, and isn't easy to modify. Searching for a better
markdown editor which is small, and doesn't have external dependicies, yielded no
results. So I decided to write a small, easy to modify, markdown editor.

<!-- more start -->

The result is [Uedit][4], a markdown editor that **Just Works** in IE6+, Opera,
Firefox, Chromium and Safari. Uedit supports automatic insertion of list items,
and a custom state manager for fine control of undo/redo operations. Note that
I haven't tested it in IE9 since that means installing an instance of Windows 7
just for that purpose. Someone will test it eventually, and if you do please
let me know if you find any bugs.

## How to get it

You can download uedit packaged in a Zip file [here][2]. Or you can clone
the [repository at github][1].

## Bugs, suggestions, patches

Please let me know if you find any bugs in uedit. I'm sure that I've made
some. Suggestions are welcome, patches even more so. Just drop me a
pull request on github if you have a patch ready.

## Thank you

[Goran Zdjelar][3] has helped with the design of uedit. He's responsible for
the nice forms design. Thanks!
