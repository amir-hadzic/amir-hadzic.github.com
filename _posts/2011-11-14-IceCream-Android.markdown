Android IceCream source code has been finally [released][announce-message] into
the wild! IceCream (or Android 4.0) has a lot of new features that will refresh
your Samsung Galaxy S or Galaxy S II. Here's to hoping that custom RAM's will
be released soon and we will be able to upgrade both Galaxy S and Galaxy S II
models.
