I’ve just finished reading a great post from Steven Benner and I couldn’t agree
more. He sums it up in one sentence:

> _Look for someone who truly understand the concepts, who can offer creative
> and alternative ideas, and who shows the ability to grow as a programmer.
> Then you will finally find a real programmer._

If you want to be a real programmer you need to learn, you need to constantly
develop your skills. If you stop doing that, if you lock yourself inside your
bubble and see no further than that, then you have a problem. Stepping into
that magic bubble is quite easy if you are working in a team, constantly trying
to meet deadlines but it’s by no means a valid justification. Again, Benner
summed it up like this:

> _If you ever finish learning, then your career as a programmer is over._
