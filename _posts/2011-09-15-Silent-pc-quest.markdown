Lately it's been very uncomfortable to sit in front of my PC for longer periods
of time simply because the CPU fan gets extremely loud. The fact that there are
three additional fans on the case ([Thermaltake V9][case-link]) doesn't help either.
A simple google query or two and I found two candidates for my upgrade:
[Thermaltake Jing][jing-link] and [Thermaltake Frio][frio-link]. The price
difference was not big and I ultimately decided to go with Jing because Frio was
not in stock.

Putting it all together didn't go as easy as I planned it would. I'v spent more
hours replacing the fan than I feel comfortable to admit. Basically the
problem was that one of the parts was not drilled properly during the production
and after a lot of frustration I had to drill a bigger hole and use different
screws to hold it in place. It would have been a better idea to replace the fan
altogether because it had a defect but I thought that I would waste more time
going that route. This made me moderately frustrated.

I made another mistake while replacing the fan. I placed the CPU together with
the fan on the motherboard and then tried to attach the motherboard back into
the case. Word of advice: do not do this. Simply attach the CPU holder that
goes on the back of the motherboard and then attach the motherboard into the
case without mounting the fan. The problem with the first approach is that the 
Jing fan is huge. You will not have a lot of space to tighten the screws that 
hold the motherboard in place and you will ultimately end up removing the fan. 
That's what I did anyway. While trying to place the fan (and the CPU) back to 
the motherboard I didn't align the CPU correctly. At this point I was very 
frustrated and should have gone to bed way before doing something stupid like this. 
Playing around with an expensive CPU is simply wrong. CPUs in general are very 
sensitive.

You can probably guess what happened at this point. I wasn't able to boot my PC.
That's when I decided to go to sleep. The next day I adjusted the CPU, attached
the fan again and everything was fine. Well, everything except the fact that
Windows is not able to boot anymore. That's fine though, I'm not in the mood to
play games anyway. I'll stick with archlinux.

The good news is that the [Jing][jing-link] fan is completely silent. The only
audible sound coming from my PC is the top fan which is probably going to get
replaced too.
