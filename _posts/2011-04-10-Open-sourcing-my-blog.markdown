I have decided to use [Jekyll][0] to generate the required files for my static blog. I was feeling adventorous so I also decided to host my [blog contents][1] on GitHub. I also hope that I'm going to write some constructive posts in the future. If you haven't noticed, I'm using Disqus for comments from now on.

**Update**: The blog is now hosted completely at github.com. They now support custom domains even for free accounts. Go github!
