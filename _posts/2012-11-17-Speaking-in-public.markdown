Do you dread speaking in front of a wider audience? Most people do. But after
this weekend I will be a bit better at it than I used to be. Public speaking
just like everything else takes practice but it's especially hard at the
beginning.

<!-- more start -->

Startup Weekend was in town yesterday and initially I planned to spend the whole
weekend working on an idea that I had for a while or on someone else's (more
interesting) idea. To cut a long story short it turned out that I won't have a
lot of spare time during the weekend so I was considering not going at all.

I decided to go and pitch my idea anyways—I figured that it's a nice challenge
to speak in front of that many people.  For those of you that haven't read about
startup weekend you basically have one minute to pitch your idea and later on
people vote for the most popular ideas.  Once that's finished teams are formed
around the ideas and they continue to work on them during the weekend. It's a
great opportunity to meet interesting people, make new connections and have fun
while working on something you really love.

But one of the most important things is that it's a great opportunity to get out
of your comfort zone and that's exactly what I did. I decided that I'm going to
pitch my idea in front of ~100 people just to see if I can pull it off. 

There are a few key points I tried to follow when giving the talk but also some
things that I noticed when other attendees were giving their pitches.

 - Don't talk too fast. This is especially important when you are talking in a
   language that you don't speak fluently. Your audience won't understand what
   you are talking about and you will lose their focus.
 - You need to know what you are going to talk about. I'm not saying that you
   need to know word-by-word what you need to say but make sure that you have a
   few key points that you want to talk about.
 - Try to connect with the people that you are talking to. This one might be
   really hard if you are not talking frequently in public. At least it was for
   me since the only thing that I felt at the moment I started talking was a
   huge rush of adrenalin (a subtle joke when starting the talk might help).
 - If you want to make people interested then talk about something they care
   about.  Talk about it in terms of what they get by following you or your
   idea.  There's a whole chapter about this in a really nice book ["How to win
   friends and influence people"][0].

My pitch went something like this:

> Hello everyone, my name is Amir. I'm a software developer by day and a wannabe
> freelancer by night and I want to help you—I want to help small businesses.

> Shared workspaces are not something new. There are shared workspaces in most
> developed countries and they are usually referred to as coworking spaces. Our
> neighboring countries such as Croatia and Serbia have coworking spaces.
> These spaces usually rent out individual desks and have different pricing
> options for different team sizes.

> What I don't know is how big the market is and what exactly "affordable" means
> and that's one of the most important things that I'm planning to work on
> during this weekend. I would definitely appreciate all the help I can get.

> Starting a company in Bosnia is not cheap when compared to other developed
> countries and I want to help keep those costs down by building the first
> coworking space in Sarajevo.

That's pretty much it. I want to build a coworking space in Sarajevo for small
businesses. I actually practiced the speech a couple of times before attending
the event and I consistently managed to get it done in around 50 seconds. I
broke the time limit by a couple of seconds when I gave the pitch in front of
the audience. My guess is that I wondered of and talked about something else
for a couple of seconds.

But I did it. I went out of my comfort zone and it didn't hurt. You can do it
too. If nothing else it will help you practice your public speaking skills for
more serious situations such as important meetings.

I also got some nice feedback for the idea. There were some attendees that
actually needed something like this and it also got accepted (based on the
number of votes) but as I already said there were more important things that I
had to finish during the weekend.

I'm actually looking forward to speak in public again.
